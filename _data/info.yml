description_short: "Workshop on Gender Inequality"
description_long: |
  The workshop aims to foster critical conversations on emerging policy challenges and exchange cutting-edge research addressing gender inequality in a rapidly changing world. At a time when conservative movements are increasingly challenging womenâ€™s rights, and transformative trends such as technology and climate change are reshaping global dynamics, it is imperative to understand how these forces can either advance or hinder progress toward gender equality. Simultaneously, longstanding issues like fertility, labour force participation, and caregiving norms are undergoing significant shifts, necessitating fresh perspectives and collaborative approaches.

  This workshop is uniquely positioned to lead this dialogue, drawing on the combined expertise and policy-oriented focus of three departments, the Department of Social Policy at LSE, the AXA Gender Lab at Bocconi, and NYU Abu Dhabi, that have been at the forefront of creating vibrant communities of gender researchers across Europe. By bringing together scholars, policymakers, and advocates, we aim to illuminate pathways for meaningful change and build a collective vision for a more equitable future.
